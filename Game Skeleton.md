Game: Character moving around, collect scoins for points, every 10 points is a new level. Touching the border removes 1 life. Can gain more lives by collecting crystal in the game. The higher the level you reach, the more likely it is a wall will pop up randomly and block your way (you lose 1 life if you touch it), the faster you get and the smaller the coin gets. 10 levels till you win, but if you lose all your lives you have to restart from 1.
